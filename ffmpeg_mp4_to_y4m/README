Notes :
1.  This tar contains the File decoder code. MP4Handler class is responsible for opening mp4 file and decoding it 
packet by packet.
2. MP4Driver.cpp contains main, which drives this program.
3. This code does not handle dumping of audio data, and as per my understanding, it may not be possible
to have audio in y4m files (Which could be incorrect).
4. My understanding and comments about the problem are in the header comment of MP4Handler.cpp 
5. There is no make file written. I used a command line
 g++ -g -Wall -o MP4Decoder  MP4Handler.cpp MP4Decoder.cpp -I /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu  -I. -lavcodec -lavformat -lavutil -lswresample -L /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu   -lz -lm -lpthread  -lstdc++
